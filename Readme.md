# Motivation behind the project

Privacy is a tricky subject and can't be addressed in a Readme file. At the moment of this writing social media seems to be a liability for users. On one hand, social media *can* be useful as a way to obtain information from selected channels, tailored to your needs or tastes. On the other, interactions with people in social media *can* be hard to navigate correctly. 

It seems in some scenarios tehse interactions have had a direct impact on the employability of people. I'm not talking about some famous person exposing views that go against   basic tenets of the Human Rights Declaration; I refer to more mundane, albeit confrontational, interactions between people that have had lasting consequences in the real world.

I acknowledge this is a form of self-censorship that shouldn't be required in a free society. You can call me a coward. But, as thing stands and until we get better at social media it seems silly not to mitigate risks like these.
